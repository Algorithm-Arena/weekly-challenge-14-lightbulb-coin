# Weekly Challenge #14 - Lightbulb Coin

**For this challenge, you need to implement a blockchain using md5 as the hash function that stores a ledger for ðŸ’¡ coins.** There's a lot of talks about crypto-currencies but most people don't realize how simple the ideas and implementation behind it are. The [original Bitcoin paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) is just 9 pages long.

In second place, @Uzo2005 wins $50. I really like how the miner is just a while loop picking up random numbers and checking if the md5 hash starts with 4 zeroes, so simple and elegant.
